Easily embed Spotify playlists, albums and tracks into your posts through the new Spotify Play Button.

== Description ==

Spotify Embed is based on the new [API by Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-play-button/), better known as the Spotify Play Button.
With Spotify Embed you can easily share your favored music tracks, albums and playlists with other Spotify users.

= What's your part? =
Just place a Spotify link into your posts. It can be a link to your favored track or album, but also music playlists are possible.
**By default no shortcodes are necessary, just a link!**
And that was about your part. Easy, isn't it?

= What does the plugin? =
The plugin will fetch your links of your music and will convert it to a sexy Spotify Play Button.

= Some usage examples =
To embed a simple Track just embed a link like this:
`https://open.spotify.com/track/4IJUii1lg0IRLBs0yG1w2p`

To embed an album just embed a link like this:
`http://open.spotify.com/album/4pT0rlFvHYc46KyEhmCy88`

Or to embed a complete playlist just embed a link like this:
`http://open.spotify.com/user/sonymusic/playlist/1BVPSd4dynzdlIWehjvkPj`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I embed the light theme instead of the dark theme? =
Yes, you can. Just wrap your link into the `[embed][/embed]` shortcode and add the keyword 'light'.
Example:
`[embed light]http://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/3Yrvm5lBgnhzTYTXx2l55x[/embed]`


= I want to show the cover art, is that possible? =
Yes. Just wrap your link into the `[embed][/embed]` shortcode and add the keyword 'coverart'.
Example:
`[embed coverart]http://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/3Yrvm5lBgnhzTYTXx2l55x[/embed]`


= Where does the plugin get it's default height and width settings? =
Therefor take a look at the Media settings under `Settings > Media > Embed`.


= Can I customize the size of the embed box? =
Yes. Just wrap your link into the `[embed][/embed]` shortcode and add the keywords 'height' and/or 'width'.
(Note: Take also a look at the [Spotify documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-play-button/documentation/))
Example:
`[embed height="600" width="450"]http://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/3Yrvm5lBgnhzTYTXx2l55x[/embed]`

Another option is the use of the `size` keyword. You can use `size="compact"` (80x250px) or `size="large"` (720x640px).
Example:
`[embed size="compact"]http://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/3Yrvm5lBgnhzTYTXx2l55x[/embed]`


= Can I combine all these keywords? =
Yes. (But don't try to combine the size keywords, or the sky will fall on your head)
